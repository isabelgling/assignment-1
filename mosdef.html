    <h1>Mos Def</h1>
    <p> Mos Def, currently known as Yasiin Bey is a rapper from Brooklyn, NY, renowned for his socially conscious rap. He was a member of legendary rap duo, Black Star, along with fellow Brooklyn rapper Talib Kweli. I like his story-telling and his use as hip hop as a platform for activism. </p>
