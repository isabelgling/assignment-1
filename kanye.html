    <h1>Kanye West</h1>
    <p> Kanye West is a Chicago-raised rapper infamous for his public antics. However, I believe he belongs in the top 5 because he has transformed hip hop from just a genre to an experience. I also admire how his interests in art and fashion challenge the concept of masculinity that characterizes much of hip hop. </p>
